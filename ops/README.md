# Operations and Productivity Workflows

This section contains n8n workflows designed to support operational and productivity tasks across professional, administrative, and coordination contexts.

The workflows in this area focus on reducing routine workload, improving information flow, and supporting timely decision-support and coordination, while keeping people in control of judgement and actions.

---

## Scope

Workflows in this section may support activities such as:

- inbox triage and message routing
- task and follow-up coordination
- scheduling and calendar support
- preparation of briefings or summaries
- routine reporting and status updates

These workflows are intended to support professional practice and do not replace managerial judgement, accountability, or organisational processes.

---

## Design approach

All workflows in this section are designed to:

- support efficient coordination without removing human oversight
- make workflow logic transparent and adjustable
- be adaptable to different roles and organisational contexts
- minimise unnecessary handling of personal or sensitive data

Where generative AI is used, outputs are intended to assist prioritisation and drafting rather than automate decisions or actions.

---

## Workflow structure

Each workflow is provided as a self-contained folder that typically includes:

- a `.json` file for import into n8n  
- a `.png` overview of the workflow structure  
- a `README.md` describing setup, use, and limitations  
- optional capability notes offering contextual guidance for responsible use at scale

---

## Using these workflows

To use any workflow in this section you will need an existing n8n instance (n8n Cloud or self-hosted).

General setup and credential guidance is available in:
- `docs/setup-n8n.md`
- `docs/credentials.md`

Users should test workflows with non-sensitive data and ensure alignment with local organisational policies and practices.

---

## Status

Workflows will be added to this section incrementally as they are designed, tested, and documented. The structure of this folder is intended to scale as additional operational use cases are developed.
