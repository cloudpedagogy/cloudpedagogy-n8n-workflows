# Research Workflows

This section contains n8n workflows designed to support research practice and research operations across academic and applied research contexts.

The workflows in this area focus on reducing administrative overhead, supporting synthesis and sense-making, and assisting with preparation of research outputs, while keeping researchers in control of interpretation and decision-making.

---

## Scope

Workflows in this section may support activities such as:

- monitoring literature, policy, or funding calls
- synthesising research notes or draft materials
- supporting writing, editing, and reporting workflows
- coordinating research administration and communication
- preparing briefings or summaries for different audiences

These workflows are not intended to replace scholarly judgement, peer review, or research ethics processes.

---

## Design approach

All workflows in this section are designed to:

- support research thinking and synthesis rather than automate conclusions
- keep researchers clearly responsible for interpretation and final outputs
- be adaptable across disciplines and research methods
- avoid unnecessary handling of sensitive or identifiable research data

Where generative AI is used, outputs are intended as drafts or prompts for further human refinement.

---

## Workflow structure

Each workflow is provided as a self-contained folder that typically includes:

- a `.json` file for import into n8n  
- a `.png` overview of the workflow structure  
- a `README.md` describing setup, use, and limitations  
- optional capability notes offering contextual guidance for responsible use at scale

---

## Using these workflows

To use any workflow in this section you will need an existing n8n instance (n8n Cloud or self-hosted).

General setup and credential guidance is available in:
- `docs/setup-n8n.md`
- `docs/credentials.md`

Users should test workflows with non-sensitive data and ensure alignment with local research governance and ethics requirements.

---

## Status

Workflows will be added to this section incrementally as they are designed, tested, and documented. The structure of this folder is intended to scale as additional research-focused use cases are developed.
