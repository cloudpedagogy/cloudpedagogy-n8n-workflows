# CloudPedagogy n8n Workflows

Practical n8n automations for higher education, research, and professional operations.

This repository hosts a growing collection of reusable workflows designed to support **sense-making, coordination, and decision-support** tasks in academic and research contexts. These workflows are intended to **strengthen organisational capability**, not simply automate tasks.

All workflows are designed to be **human-in-the-loop**, adaptable to local practice, and suitable for use by individuals or teams across a range of institutional settings.

> **Status:** This repository is under active development. Workflows are added incrementally as they are designed, tested, and documented.

---

## Repository structure

Workflows are organised by area of practice:

### `higher-education/`
Digital education leadership, governance, curriculum operations, quality assurance, and academic coordination.

### `research/`
Research operations, literature monitoring, writing, synthesis, research communication, and reporting support.

### `ops/`
General productivity, inbox triage, scheduling, and coordination workflows applicable across professional contexts.

Shared guidance is provided in:

### `docs/`
Setup instructions, credential handling, and design principles that apply across all workflows.

---

## What you’ll find in each workflow

Each workflow is provided as a self-contained folder, typically including:

- a `.json` file for import into n8n  
- a `.png` overview of the workflow structure  
- a `README.md` with setup, configuration, and usage instructions  
- optional capability notes offering contextual guidance for responsible and scalable use  

---

## Design approach

Workflows in this repository are presented as **operational patterns** that can be adapted to different institutional contexts, tools, and governance arrangements.

All workflows are designed to:

- support **human judgement** rather than automate decisions  
- make workflow logic **visible, inspectable, and adaptable**  
- minimise unnecessary data handling and system coupling  
- be suitable for use in **higher education and research environments**, including regulated and risk-aware contexts  

Design principles and cross-cutting guidance are documented in:

- `docs/design-principles.md`

---

## Getting started

To use these workflows you will need an existing n8n instance (either n8n Cloud or a self-hosted deployment).

General setup and credential guidance is available in:

- `docs/setup-n8n.md`  
- `docs/credentials.md`
