# CloudPedagogy n8n Workflows

Practical n8n automations for higher education, research, and professional operations.

This repository will host a growing collection of reusable workflows designed to support sense-making, coordination, and decision-support tasks in academic and research contexts. Workflows are designed to be human-in-the-loop, adaptable to local practice, and suitable for individual or team use.

> **Status:** This repository is under active development. Workflows will be added incrementally as they are designed, tested, and documented.

---

## Repository structure

Workflows are organised by area of practice:

- **`higher-education/`**  
  Digital education leadership, governance, curriculum operations, and academic coordination.

- **`research/`**  
  Research operations, literature monitoring, writing, synthesis, and reporting support.

- **`ops/`**  
  General productivity, inbox triage, scheduling, and coordination workflows.

Shared guidance is provided in:

- **`docs/`**  
  Setup instructions, credential handling, and design principles that apply across workflows.

---

## What you’ll find in each workflow

Each workflow will be provided as a self-contained folder including:

- a **`.json`** file for import into n8n  
- a **`.png`** overview of the workflow structure  
- a **`README.md`** with setup and usage instructions  
- optional **capability notes** offering contextual guidance for responsible use at scale

---

## Design approach

All workflows in this repository are designed to:

- support human judgement rather than automate decisions  
- make workflow logic visible and adaptable  
- minimise unnecessary data handling  
- be suitable for use in higher-education and research environments

---

## Getting started

To use these workflows you will need an existing n8n instance (n8n Cloud or self-hosted).

General setup and credential guidance is available in:
- `docs/setup-n8n.md`
- `docs/credentials.md`
