# Higher Education Workflows

This section contains n8n workflows designed for higher education contexts, with a particular focus on digital education leadership, governance, curriculum operations, and academic coordination.

The workflows in this area are intended to support sense-making, coordination, and decision-support tasks commonly undertaken by academic leaders, learning technologists, and professional services staff.

---

## Scope

Workflows in this section may support activities such as:

- synthesising consultation responses and feedback
- preparing meeting materials, minutes, and decision logs
- monitoring policy, regulatory, or sector developments
- supporting curriculum and quality assurance processes
- coordinating cross-faculty or cross-departmental inputs

These workflows are not student-facing systems and do not automate academic judgement or institutional decisions.

---

## Design approach

All workflows in this section are designed to:

- operate as **decision-support tools**, not decision-making systems
- keep humans clearly in control of interpretation and approval
- be adaptable to different institutional contexts and practices
- avoid unnecessary integration with sensitive institutional systems

Where generative AI is used, outputs are intended for review and refinement rather than direct publication or action.

---

## Workflow structure

Each workflow is provided as a self-contained folder that typically includes:

- a `.json` file for import into n8n
- a `.png` overview of the workflow structure
- a `README.md` describing setup, use, and limitations
- optional capability notes offering contextual guidance for use at scale

---

## Using these workflows

To use any workflow in this section you will need an existing n8n instance (n8n Cloud or self-hosted).

General setup and credential guidance is available in:
- `docs/setup-n8n.md`
- `docs/credentials.md`

Users should test workflows with non-sensitive data before applying them to live processes.

---

## Status

Workflows will be added to this section incrementally as they are designed, tested, and documented. The structure of this folder is intended to scale as additional higher-education use cases are developed.
